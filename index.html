			<p class="content">Jasmine can be either deciduous (leaves falling in autumn) or evergreen (green all year round), and can be erect, spreading, or climbing shrubs and vines. 
			Their leaves are borne in opposing or alternating arrangement and can be of simple, trifoliate, or pinnate formation.Jasmine is cultivated commercially for domestic and industrial uses, such as the perfume industry.[24] It is used in rituals like marriages, religious ceremonies, and festivals.[25] Jasmine flower vendors sell garlands of jasmine, or in the case of the thicker motiyaa (in Hindi) or mograa (in Marathi) varieties, bunches of jasmine are common.[26] They may be found around entrances to temples, on major thoroughfares, and in major business areas.

			A change in presidency in Tunisia in 1987[27][28] and the Tunisian Revolution of 2011 are both called "Jasmine revolutions" in reference to the flower.[29]

			"Jasmine" is a common female given name.The flowers are typically around 2.5 cm (0.98 in) in diameter. They are white or yellow, although in rare instances they can be slightly reddish. The flowers are borne in cymose clusters with a minimum of three flowers, though they can also be solitary on the ends of branchlets. Each flower has about four to nine petals, two locules, and one to four ovules. They have two stamens with very short filaments. The bracts are linear or ovate. The calyx is bell-shaped.
			They are usually very fragrant.[7][additional citation(s) needed]</p>
